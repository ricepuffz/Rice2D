# Rice2D
### Important Note
**THIS PROJECT IS AN UNRELEASED WIP**  
Using the sourcecode to create anything should happen solely for testing purposes. The engine in its current state contains way too
many bugs and overall design flaws which have to be fixed and reworked before any attempt at a proper program/game should be made.

### Description
Rice2D is my personal attempt at creating a fully functional 2D engine using nothing but the least amount of required LWJGL
bindings. The main focus of this project is for me to learn anything from advanced vector mathematics to engine design, more from
trial and error than simply copying other people's work, while also getting more acquainted with a workflow including GitHub, 
Maven etc.  
An usage guide and documentations will be made as soon as the basic engine functionality has been implemented and debugged to an
usable state.
